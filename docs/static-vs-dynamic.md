# Static vs Dynamic Website Comparison

## Current Setup: Static Website

### How It Works:
```
Build Time (Once):
Next.js → Generates HTML files → Stores in /out/ folder

Runtime (Every Visit):
User Request → Web Server → Serves Pre-built HTML → Browser
             (No processing, just file serving)
```

### File Structure After Build:
```
/public_html/
├── index.html              (Homepage - pre-built)
├── about/index.html        (About page - pre-built)  
├── services/index.html     (Services - pre-built)
├── contact/index.html      (Contact - pre-built)
└── book-appointment/index.html (Booking - pre-built)
```

### Characteristics:
- ✅ **Pre-generated**: All pages built once during deployment
- ✅ **No server processing**: Just serves files
- ✅ **Same content**: Every user sees identical pages
- ✅ **Fast**: No database queries or server logic
- ✅ **Cacheable**: CDN can cache everything
- ✅ **Cheap hosting**: Works on basic web servers

## Option 2: Dynamic Website

### How It Would Work:
```
Runtime (Every Visit):
User Request → Next.js Server → Database Query → Generate HTML → Browser
             (Server processing on every request)
```

### File Structure After Build:
```
/server/
├── .next/                  (Next.js server files)
├── pages/api/             (API endpoints)
├── database/              (Database connection)
└── node_modules/          (Server dependencies)
```

### Characteristics:
- ❌ **Generated on-demand**: Pages built for each request
- ❌ **Server processing**: Runs code on every visit
- ❌ **Personalized content**: Different users see different data
- ❌ **Slower**: Database queries + server logic
- ❌ **Not cacheable**: Dynamic content changes
- ❌ **Expensive hosting**: Needs Node.js server
