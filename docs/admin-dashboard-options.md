# Admin Dashboard Implementation Options

## Option 1: Separate Admin App (Recommended)
- Keep main site static (current setup)
- Create separate Next.js app for admin at `/admin` subdirectory
- Deploy admin app to different hosting (Vercel/Netlify)
- Use subdomain: admin.yourdomain.com

### Pros:
- Main site stays fast (static)
- Admin has full server capabilities
- Better security separation
- Independent deployments

### Cons:
- Two separate applications to maintain
- Additional hosting costs for admin

## Option 2: Convert to Full Next.js App
- Remove `output: 'export'` from next.config.ts
- Add API routes for admin functionality
- Deploy to Node.js hosting (not shared hosting)
- Add authentication middleware

### Pros:
- Single application
- Shared components and styling
- Unified deployment

### Cons:
- Main site becomes slower (SSR)
- Need Node.js hosting (more expensive)
- More complex deployment

## Option 3: External Admin Service
- Use headless CMS (Strapi, Sanity, Contentful)
- Keep main site static
- Admin manages content via external dashboard
- Rebuild site when content changes

### Pros:
- Main site stays static and fast
- Professional admin interface
- Built-in user management

### Cons:
- Monthly subscription costs
- Learning curve for new platform
- Less customization

## Recommended Implementation: Option 1

### Current Site Structure (Keep as-is):
```
yourdomain.com/          → Static Next.js site
├── /                    → Homepage
├── /about               → About page
├── /services            → Services page
├── /contact             → Contact form
└── /book-appointment    → Booking form
```

### New Admin App Structure:
```
admin.yourdomain.com/    → Full Next.js app
├── /login               → Admin login
├── /dashboard           → Admin dashboard
├── /appointments        → View/manage appointments
├── /messages            → View/manage contact messages
└── /api/                → API routes for CRUD operations
```

### Implementation Steps:
1. Create new Next.js project for admin
2. Set up authentication (NextAuth.js)
3. Add database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
4. Create API routes for data management
5. Deploy to Vercel/Railway/DigitalOcean
6. Point admin.yourdomain.com to admin app
