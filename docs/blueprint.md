- Background color: Soft beige background (#F7F3EC) is used to create a clean and inviting canvas, that matches the gold primary color but does not distract.
- Accent color: A deep teal (#1F4762) complements the gold by adding contrast while keeping a natural harmony. This teal anchors key interactive elements like buttons, and links, grounding the layout.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern and globally friendly feel.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) to give headlines a modern, techy, and scientific vibe.
- Use icons related to education, travel, and global connectivity.
- Employ modular components for services and blog sections to ensure design consistency and ease of updates.
- Subtle animations on hover interactions and page transitions enhance user engagement without overwhelming.
